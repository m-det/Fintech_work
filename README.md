 I have an MBA with a management concentration and have been working in healthcare administration for about 12 years. 

I would like to open a consulting firm that specializes in financial analysis and fintech tools for small business. 

I chose fintech as a career path because i think blockchain and machine learning are going to revolutionize almost every industry.
